To-Do List  Web Application

For Task-1, I worked on creating a dynamic To-Do List application. This task allowed me to showcase my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by developing a user-friendly interface that helps users to manage their tasks efficiently.

Key features of the application include:

ðŸ”¹ A visually appealing and responsive design implemented using HTML and CSS.

ðŸ”¹ Dynamic functionality achieved with JavaScript, enabling users to add, edit, and remove their tasks.
